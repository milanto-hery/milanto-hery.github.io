      <h2>Academic & Research Path</h2>

      <p>
        I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in <strong>[Field]</strong> from
        <a href="https://www.example-university.edu" target="_blank">
          [University Name]
        </a>,
        where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics, physics,
        and computational methods. This training shaped my interest in
        data-driven approaches to scientific problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I later completed my Master’s degree in <strong>[Field]</strong> at
        <a href="https://www.example-university.edu" target="_blank">
          [University Name]
        </a>,
        focusing on machine learning, signal processing, and applied data science.
        My research explored topics such as bioacoustic analysis,
        compressed sensing, and deep learning for environmental monitoring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside formal degrees, I have participated in specialized
        training schools and international conferences, including
        <strong>[Conference Name]</strong> and
        <strong>[Summer School / Workshop Name]</strong>,
        gaining exposure to interdisciplinary research at the intersection
        of AI, ecology, and conservation.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. I design intelligent systems that extract meaningful insights from complex data to inform real-world decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience spans the full data pipeline: data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment. I emphasize robust data representation and interpretable machine learning models.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research is interdisciplinary, focusing on AI applications in environmental monitoring, wildlife conservation, and ecological analysis, including bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote sensing for large-scale automated analysis.

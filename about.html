    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a background in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on developing data-driven methods to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and support informed decision-making.
  My experience covers the full data pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment. I am particularly interested in interpretable and robust machine learning approaches, with interdisciplinary applications in environmental monitoring, wildlife conservation, and ecological analysis, spanning bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote sensing.

      I completed my Bachelor’s degree in <strong>[Field]</strong> at
      <a href="https://www.univ-antananarivo.mg" target="_blank">
        the University of Antananarivo
      </a>,
      where I built a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and computational methods.
      I later pursued a Master’s degree in <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> at
      <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za" target="_blank">
        Stellenbosch University
      </a>,
      with a focus on machine learning methods applied to ecology and wildlife monitoring.

    <p>
      I have presented my research in diverse academic and interdisciplinary settings, addressing audiences from different scientific backgrounds and countries. This includes presenting my work at international conferences such as <strong>[Conference A]</strong>, as well as contributing to thematic discussions and scientific dialogue sessions focused on artificial intelligence, ecology, and conservation. These experiences strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and engage with researchers across disciplines.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a background
      in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on
      developing data-driven methods to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets
      and support informed decision-making.

            My interest in science and technology developed early, driven by a curiosity for how natural systems work and how technology can be used to understand and protect them. 
            This dual passion for nature and computation guided my academic path, beginning with a Bachelor’s degree in Physics at the <a href="https://www.univ-antananarivo.mg" target="_blank">the University of Antananarivo</a>, 
            where I built a strong foundation in mathematics, physical modeling, and analytical reasoning. During my Master’s studies, I became increasingly drawn to machine learning and data-driven approaches. 
            I chose to focus my MSc project on machine learning for time-series prediction, which marked a turning point toward applied artificial intelligence. 
            This experience led to my selection for the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), where I completed an intensive one-year program in mathematical sciences and machine learning. 
            
            At AIMS, I studied advanced machine learning methods and conducted applied research on data-driven modeling for neurodegenerative diseases.
            Building on this background, I later specialized in machine learning for ecology at <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za" target="_blank">Stellenbosch University</a>, 
            applying AI techniques to environmental monitoring and wildlife conservation.  Across these stages, my academic journey has been shaped by a consistent goal: developing rigorous, interpretable machine learning methods that address real-world scientific and societal challenges

            Alongside my academic training, I have engaged in scientific communication through conferences, workshops, and specialized training programs. I have presented my work on multiple occasions through posters, oral presentations
            and technical talks in different countries. I attended the "Foundational Methods in Data Science” scheduled from March 19, 2023 to April 8, 2023 at AIMS Rwanda in Kigali, where 
            I studied mathematical foundations of machine learning and AI, including optimization, functional analysis, topology, geometry, and probability theory. 
            Just after that, I participated in the Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023).
            

            
            More recently, I presented my research at the Vatican African Conference on Climate Resilience, Nairobi, Kenya organised by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 
            Itook part in structured dialogue sessions focused on youth engagement, science, and technology for sustainable development. 
            These experiences have reinforced the importance of clear, accessible scientific communication and have shaped my approach to presenting machine learning research with real-world impact.

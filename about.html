        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a solid foundation
            in mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My passion is building intelligent systems
            that extract meaningful insights from complex data to support real-world decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience across the full data science pipeline — from raw data acquisition and
            preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment. I prioritize creating models
            that are robust, interpretable, and grounded in the realities of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research focuses on environmental monitoring, wildlife conservation, and ecological analysis,
            including bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote sensing, where automated analysis of large-scale
            datasets is essential.

      <h2>The Journey Behind the Data</h2>
      <p>
        I am Milanto, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher driven by the intersection of applied
        mathematics,
        environmental conservation, and computational modeling. My mission is to develop precise, scalable models
        that transform complex data into actionable ecological insights.

              <p>
                My fascination with natural systems and computational logic began during my BSc in Physics at the
                University of Antananarivo.
                This foundation in mathematical modeling led me to an MSc focused on time-series prediction, a pivotal
                moment where
                I realized the potential of Artificial Intelligence in solving real-world challenges.
                I delved deep into the nuances of data patterns and physical phenomena, learning how to translate
                natural observations into robust mathematical frameworks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I later joined the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), where I immersed myself in
                advanced machine learning.
                This journey continued at Stellenbosch University, where I applied AI techniques to environmental
                monitoring and wildlife protection,
                solidifying my goal of developing impactful scientific solutions. My research here emphasized the
                importance of interpretability and ethical considerations in AI-driven conservation strategies.

            <h3>Global Engagement</h3>
            <div class="text-fade-container">
              <p>
                Active engagement in the scientific community is central to my work. I have presented research on
                foundational
                data science methods at AIMS Rwanda and participated in the Eleventh International Conference on
                Learning Representations (ICLR 2023).
                These platforms allowed me to exchange ideas with leading experts and stay at the forefront of AI
                innovation, ensuring that my methods are both rigorous and state-of-the-art.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, I contributed to the Vatican African Conference on Climate Resilience in Nairobi, Kenya,
                exploring
                nature-based solutions for sustainable action. These experiences have refined my ability to communicate
                complex scientific concepts to diverse audiences, ensuring that research has a tangible impact on
                climate and conservation policy.
                I believe that effective communication is the bridge between theoretical research and meaningful,
                real-world change.

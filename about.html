    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Milanto. I am a data scientist and machine learning researcher. I also have a background in applied mathematics, physics and computational modeling. 
      My work focuses on creating methods based on data that can help us understand complex situations and make the right decisions.

            I was interested in science and technology from a young age. I was curious about how natural systems work and how technology can be used to understand and protect them. 

             </p>

                <p>
            
            My love of nature and computers guided my academic path. I did my BSc in Physics at the <a href="https://www.univ-antananarivo.mg" target="_blank">the University of Antananarivo</a>, where I earned a solid foundation in mathematics, physical modelling and analytical reasoning. 
            While I was doing my MSc, I became more and more interested in machine learning and data-driven methods. I decided to focus my project on machine learning for time-series prediction, which was a turning point for me in my work with artificial intelligence. 
            This experience led to my selection for the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), where I completed an intensive one-year programme in mathematical sciences and machine learning. 
             </p>
                <p>
            At AIMS, I studied advanced machine learning methods and did research on data-driven modelling for neurodegenerative diseases.
            I then went on to do research in machine learning for ecology at <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za" target="_blank">Stellenbosch University</a>, using AI techniques to monitor the environment and protect wildlife.  
                  My academic journey has been shaped by one goal: developing accurate machine learning methods that can be used to solve real scientific and social problems.

            Alongside my academic training, I have engaged in scientific communication through conferences, workshops, and special training programs. I have presented my work on multiple occasions through posters, oral presentations
            and technical talks in different countries.
          </p>
            <p>
            I attended the "Foundational Methods in Data Science” scheduled from March 19, 2023 to April 8, 2023 at AIMS Rwanda in Kigali, where 
            I studied mathematical foundations of machine learning and AI, including optimization, functional analysis, topology, geometry, and probability theory. 
            Just after that, I participated in the Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023).
            </p>

            <p>
            More recently, I presented my research at the the Vatican African Conference on Climate Resilience in Nairobi, Kenya organised by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 
            discussion about the topic of Nature-Based Solutions & Translational Research for Climate Resilient Sustainable Action.      
            These experiences have taught me how important it is to communicate scientific ideas clearly and to make them easy for people to understand.
            They have also influenced the way I present my research on machine learning and its effect on the real world.

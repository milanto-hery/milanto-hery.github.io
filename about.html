    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a background in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on developing data-driven methods to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and support informed decision-making.
  My experience covers the full data pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment. I am particularly interested in interpretable and robust machine learning approaches, with interdisciplinary applications in environmental monitoring, wildlife conservation, and ecological analysis, spanning bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote sensing.

      <p>
        I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics at
        <a href="https://www.univ-antananarivo.mg" target="_blank">
          the University of Antananarivo
        </a>,
        where I developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling,
        physics, and computational methods. I later pursued a Master’s
        degree in Applied Mathematics at
        <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za" target="_blank">
          Stellenbosch University
        </a>,
        with a focus on machine learning techniques applied to ecological
        monitoring and wildlife conservation. My academic training emphasized
        rigorous methodology, interdisciplinary collaboration, and
        real-world problem solving at the intersection of AI and environmental
        sciences.

      <p>
        I have presented my research across diverse academic and professional
        audiences through oral presentations, posters, and technical
        demonstrations. I attended international conferences, thematic
        workshops, and summer schools, where I presented my work on machine
        learning for environmental monitoring and participated in interdisciplinary
        scientific dialogues. These experiences strengthened my ability to
        communicate complex technical concepts clearly to both specialized
        and non-specialized audiences, while emphasizing reproducibility,
        transparency, and applied impact.

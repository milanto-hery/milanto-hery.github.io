        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation
            in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on building
            intelligent systems that can extract meaningful information from complex data and support
            decision-making in real-world contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the years, I have worked across the full data science and machine learning pipeline,
            from raw data acquisition and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment.
            I place particular emphasis on understanding the structure and limitations of data, designing
            robust representations, and developing models that are both effective and interpretable.
        </p>

        <p>
            My research interests are strongly interdisciplinary. I am particularly motivated by
            applications of artificial intelligence to environmental monitoring, wildlife conservation,
            and ecological analysis. This includes work in bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote
            sensing, where large-scale data and automated analysis are essential.

<!-- WORK / PHILOSOPHY -->
<section id="work" class="section light">
    <div class="container reveal">
        <h2>My Work</h2>

        <p>
            My work is driven by the belief that machine learning systems should be grounded in a deep
            understanding of both the data and the domain in which they are applied. Rather than treating
            models as black boxes, I focus on building pipelines that combine signal processing,
            statistical reasoning, and modern deep learning techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have extensive experience working with high-dimensional data such as audio signals,
            spectrograms, images, and video. This includes designing preprocessing workflows, selecting
            appropriate representations, and evaluating model performance using meaningful metrics.
            I am particularly interested in scalable systems that can operate reliably under real-world
            constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond technical development, I value clear communication and reproducibility. I aim to
            produce work that is well-documented, transparent, and accessible to both technical and
            interdisciplinary collaborators.

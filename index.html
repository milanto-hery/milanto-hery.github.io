        <p>Our planet faces accelerating biodiversity loss—an estimated 73% decline in wildlife populations since 1970—driven by habitat conversion, overexploitation, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Early, quantitative detection of population declines and ecosystem stressors is essential to prevent extinctions. Integrating scalable sensor networks (e.g., camera traps, passive acoustic recorders, and satellites) with standardized data pipelines and machine-learning analytics enables continuous monitoring, robust trend detection, and rapid identification of at‑risk species. Science-led, open, and reproducible monitoring systems therefore allow conservationists and policymakers to prioritize interventions, evaluate outcomes, and increase the likelihood of sustaining healthy ecosystems.</p>

          The principal aim of this page is to motivate researchers to explore state-of-the-art technologies
          and scientific research in the domain of applied biodiversity conservation. The integration of
          artificial intelligence and deep learning with environmental science signifies a novel approach
          to environmental conservation, with the potential to facilitate the protection of ecosystems
          and the understanding of biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This call is primarily addressed to all those involved in environmental conservation. In the face
          of increasingly degrading environmental change, there is an urgent need for all stakeholders,
          particularly scientific researchers, to collaborate to find sustainable solutions to protect
          species that are not yet extinct but are in danger.

          <h2>🌍 Environmental data monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            Environmental data monitoring involves the design and deployment of digital tools 
        for collecting, processing, and visualizing ecological information. 
        Field data are captured using passive sensors, camera devices, drones, and remote sensing platforms, 
        while advanced analytical pipelines enable efficient data fusion and interpretation. 
        The goal is to establish integrative frameworks that enhance accessibility and interoperability 
        of environmental data for scientific and community-based applications.

          <h2>🎙️ Bioacoustic analysis & wildlife detection</h2>
          <p>
            Bioacoustic analysis applies deep learning and signal processing methods to detect and classify 
        wildlife vocalizations from continuous sound recordings. 
        Spectrogram-based machine learning and compressed sensing techniques are employed 
        to automate species identification, monitor biodiversity trends, 
        and assess the ecological impacts of environmental change. 
        This approach contributes to large-scale passive acoustic monitoring and 
        the development of open-access bioacoustic datasets.

        <h2>About <span>me</span></h2>
        <p>
          I am a researcher passionate about combining artificial intelligence with ecology and sustainability.
          My passion for machine learning started when I was studying at the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar. 
          I have been slected to attend the structured Master program at the <a href="https://www.aims.ac.za/" target="_blank">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)</a> in South Africa,
          where I deepened my knowledge in machine learning, data science, and their applications. After that, I joined the <a href="https://ml-ecology.aims.ac.za/meet-the-team" target="_blank">Machine Learning for Ecology Group</a>, working on projects that leverage AI to address environmental challenges.
          My research interests include biodiversity monitoring, wildlife conservation, and environmental data analysis using deep learning techniques
        </p>

        <h2>My vision</h2>
        <p>
          My vision is to use data-driven innovation to protect biodiversity and empower local communities.
          By combining cutting-edge AI technologies with ecological knowledge, I aim to develop solutions that help monitor and conserve endangered species, restore ecosystems, and promote sustainable practices. 
          I believe that through collaboration and innovation, we can create a future where technology and nature coexist harmoniously for the benefit of all living beings.
        </p>

        <h2>VinaMaintso</h2>
        <p>
          VinaMaintso is a personal initiative I created to promote the integration of modern technology into ecological research and environmental management. 
          The word VinaMaintso is a combination of two words, originating from the Malagasy language, meaning the restoration of nature to a green world. Its primary aim is to monitor ecosystems, raise awareness about the importance of nature, and connect stakeholders and local communities in collective efforts to protect biodiversity and natural habitats. 
          Through this platform, I seek to foster environmental conservation, encourage sustainable tourism, and contribute to the broader goal of supporting national economic development through ecological stewardship.

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation
            in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on building
            intelligent systems that can extract meaningful information from complex data and support
            decision-making in real-world contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the years, I have worked across the full data science and machine learning pipeline,
            from raw data acquisition and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment.
            I place particular emphasis on understanding the structure and limitations of data, designing
            robust representations, and developing models that are both effective and interpretable.
        </p>

        <p>
            My research interests are strongly interdisciplinary. I am particularly motivated by
            applications of artificial intelligence to environmental monitoring, wildlife conservation,
            and ecological analysis. This includes work in bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote
            sensing, where large-scale data and automated analysis are essential.

<!-- WORK / PHILOSOPHY -->
<section id="work" class="section dark">
    <div class="container reveal">
        <h2>My Work</h2>

        <p>
            My work is driven by the belief that machine learning systems should be grounded in a deep
            understanding of both the data and the domain in which they are applied. Rather than treating
            models as black boxes, I focus on building pipelines that combine signal processing,
            statistical reasoning, and modern deep learning techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have extensive experience working with high-dimensional data such as audio signals,
            spectrograms, images, and video. This includes designing preprocessing workflows, selecting
            appropriate representations, and evaluating model performance using meaningful metrics.
            I am particularly interested in scalable systems that can operate reliably under real-world
            constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond technical development, I value clear communication and reproducibility. I aim to
            produce work that is well-documented, transparent, and accessible to both technical and
            interdisciplinary collaborators.

                    This project focuses on automated bird detection using passive acoustic monitoring.
                    The system integrates audio preprocessing, spectrogram analysis, compressed sensing,
                    and convolutional neural networks to detect and classify species from large-scale
                    environmental recordings.

                <p>
                    In this work, I developed an object detection pipeline for ecological monitoring
                    using YOLO-based architectures. The project involved dataset curation, annotation,
                    model training, and evaluation, with a focus on real-time inference and robustness.

                    This project explores land-cover classification using satellite imagery and deep
                    learning models. The goal is to support environmental analysis by automating the
                    interpretation of large-scale remote sensing data.

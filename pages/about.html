    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Milanto, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation
      in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on creating
      intelligent systems that extract meaningful insights from complex data to support decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience across the full data science pipeline — from raw data acquisition and preprocessing,
      to model development, evaluation, and deployment. I prioritize robust, interpretable models grounded
      in the structure and limitations of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests are interdisciplinary, particularly in AI applications for environmental monitoring,
      wildlife conservation, and ecological analysis, including bioacoustics, computer vision, and remote sensing.

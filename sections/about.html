        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Milanto Ferdinand Rasolofohery, a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation
            in applied mathematics, physics, and computational modeling. My work focuses on building
            intelligent systems that extract meaningful information from complex data and support
            decision-making in real-world contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked across the entire data science and ML pipeline: data acquisition, preprocessing,
            model development, evaluation, and deployment. I focus on understanding data structure,
            designing robust representations, and building interpretable models.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research is highly interdisciplinary. I am motivated by applications of AI to environmental
            monitoring, wildlife conservation, and ecological analysis. I work with bioacoustics, computer
            vision, and remote sensing to automate large-scale data interpretation.
